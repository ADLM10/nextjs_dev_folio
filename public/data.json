  "about": "Hello! My name is Shourya and I'm a final yr. CS Engineering student. My interest in web and app development started from my pre-college days when I tried forking an android app to get rid of ads. Turns out hacking together a custom application taught me a lot about how apps work!\n\nFast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at a start-up, and a student-led developer club. My main focus these days is learning new technologies and leveling up as a developer.\n\nI also happen to be a regular contributor to open-source projects like CircuitVerse and Flutter.\n\nHere are a few technologies I've been working with recently:\n\nTypeScript, NextJS, Supabase, FastAPI & Flutter.",
